# TENO-scheme
My implementation of TENO scheme ... Phew!

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2015.10.037

It took a quite a bit of time to implement these schemes. I am not a big fan of flux splitting approach. I prefer Godunov type Riemann solvers (HLLC, HLL, etc.)

Not still sure about TENO6... I will update when I find time. Not interested in TENO6 anymore (Jun 24th)... archived.
